# ATAV

ATAV command line tool supports tests for diagnostic analyses such as identifying putative de novo and inherited genotypes of interest in trios, and a framework for performing region-based rare-variant collapsing analyses that identify genes or other genomic units that carry an excess of qualifying variants among cases in comparison to the background variation observed in internal controls of convenience in ATAV database.
