to be used in ATAV for filtering based on domain or exon. 
The collumns are,

gene: name of the gene
sub_region: either the domain or exon 
position: vector of position values say if we have a domain
  over 3 discontinuous regions we might have something that 
  looks like chrom:start-end,start-end,start-end
BIS_percentiles_[MAF]: the percentiles of the 
  Bayesian Intolerance Scores (BIS) using different Minor Allele
  Thresholds (MAF) to define common missense variants in the 
  model.
